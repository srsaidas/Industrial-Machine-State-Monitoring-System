# Industrial-Machine-State-Monitoring-System
Machine monitoring is the process of connecting your machine to the internet to collect and interpret data by using the potential of the cloud. Before  IoT, Investigating the status of any given machine required labour intensive manual intervention. The cost to find a problem, in terms of downtime, was high.  The scope of the Industrial Machine State Monitoring System (IMSMS) project is to retrofit existing machines and provide a way for data analysis
